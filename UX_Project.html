    <p>The Expert is an app which allows our inexperienced user to post a question, chat quickly or schedule a meeting (video call) with experts of various fields to get their advice on a particular task that user wants to accomplish. In other words, a platform which allows experts & nonexperts to quickly communicate to accomplish their goal. </p>
    <div class="subheading "> Problem Statement    </div>
    <P>Historically, Users have difficulty finding experts in diverse fields in order to get advice on various subject matters. Offen responses are delayed & the advice is unreliable on online forums & the experience is not interactive.  </P>
    <div class="subheading ">Potential Solution</div>
    <p>An application which enables both experienced and inexperienced users to post a question, chat quickly, or schedule a meeting (audio/video call), with verified experts of various fields to get advice on a particular task that user wants to accomplish.</p>

              Competitive Analysis
              I began with a comprehensive competitor analysis to gain a deep understanding of the product, the current market landscape, key competitors, and their strategies. This involved evaluating the value they provide, identifying both their strengths and weaknesses (as well as my own), and assessing risks and opportunities to determine where my app would fit.
                <p>
              To gather this data, I analyzed their key objectives, overall strategies, market advantages, marketing approaches, and SWOT profiles.
            </p>
              For this project, I identified two main competitors: JustAnswer and the 6YA app.</p>

<h5>User Surveys:</h5>

 <p>User surveys give us quantitative data informing us about “what is happening”. I conducted a survey prior to interviews to get a feel for the users’ goals and pain points which provides a useful basis for scripting interview questions that can dig deeper into survey findings. This method can provide near-instant feedback and help with either redefining or confirming current design thoughts.
</p>

<h5>User Interviews:</h5>
<p>
 I conducted user interviews to gather qualitative data, allowing me to closely observe users' attitudes and body language to uncover the underlying reasons behind their behavior.
</p>
<p>To complement this, I developed a set of targeted questions and used Survey Monkey to conduct the survey.</p>

<p>Once the data was collected from both the surveys and interviews, I performed a thorough research analysis. To organize and make sense of the findings, I created a series of affinity maps to identify patterns and insights.</p>

   <p>To create a successful web app it is important to understand the types of people who will use the app. To do this I created User Personas which help establish empathy with users & help prioritize functionality based on users needs and goals. For the scope of this project, I created 2 different personas with a focus on the major needs of the most important user groups.</p>

   <p>Card sorting method helped to evaluate or generate ideas for the information architecture of a product or service. The aim is to find patterns that give clues about the most logical and user-friendly way to organize my application. which helped me structure the app, decide what to feature on the homepage, and label categories for navigation. Additionally, card sorting allowed me to better understand how users perceive the product, revealing their mental models .This insight enabled me to present information and content in the most optimal way, ensuring a smooth flow of information and an intuitive navigation experience.</p>

   <p>After the Research & Discovery phase, I gathered enough data to identify solutions, determine which features and functionalities would be effective, and prioritize and organize the information. Moving into the iteration phase, I sketched several design concepts. After reviewing these ideas, I selected one to refine further, developing detailed wireframes and user flows with annotations. Sketching allowed me to quickly generate and evaluate multiple ideas, helping to shape the design more effectively.</p>

   <p>After developing an interactive prototype its time to put it on interactive tests with in-person and remote test users. The prototype focused on testing the user task flow, rather than emphasizing UI and design principles, to assess the overall usability of the app.
<br>
    With user permission, the usability tests were recorded for later analysis. Using an affinity map, I analyzed the data extracted from recordings. This process enabled me to identify patterns of behavior and sentiment shared across multiple participants.
    <br>
    The prototypes were tested constantly and iterated progressively. A working prototype was created using Adobe XD tool for the test.  
    <br>
    During the tests, usability issues were identified and iterations were made to solve these issues and re-test for validation.

   <p>After the iteration phase & fixing all the challenges, I encountered, time to think about UI design. I was unsure which design icons, color palette to use so I conducted a preference test which helped me to make the final decision. I also realized the need for an onboarding process to enable new users to start using the app efficiently right from the start.
